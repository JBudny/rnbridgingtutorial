Following guides will showcase how to bring multiple platform experiences to React Native application, from querying basic application information, through simple UI elements and interactions with the device, ending with complex layouts.

Each guide is written in a way, that lets you consume them separately, without knowledge from the previous one, so you can just jump to any that you're interested in.

However, if you're total beginner in that topic, it's recommended to go in an order these are listed.

For more reference on how to "translate" features like methods, events, view props, etc. defined in JS code to the platform-specific code, visit [module's reference](../module-reference/module-intro) and [view's reference](../view-reference/view-intro) sections.
